# Histogram-equalization
This project uses Opencv to compute a histogram of a given image. From here the histogram can be averaged and reaplied to the image to sharpen the contrast.


To run program, execute; program histo [-h] [-m=n] imagefile [histogram]
"m=1 will be histogram equalization, m=2 is histogram matching and m=3 is histogram matching with a file (that is selected with the last argument)
